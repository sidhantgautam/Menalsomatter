# MenAlsoMatter Staging

A wellness and support platform dedicated to men’s mental health, built with **Next.js**, **Stripe**, and an engagement system based on **credits and reactivation nudges**.

---

## Project Overview

This web application powers **MenAlsoMatter.com**, a platform supporting men’s mental health.  
It allows users to donate securely, earn raffle entries, and stay engaged through a gamified credit system.  

Users not only support the cause through donations but are also motivated to stay active with **credit rewards, prize thresholds, and reactivation bonuses**.

## New Modules Added

### 🔹 Module 3 – Credit Earning (Timed & Trigger-Based)
- Users earn credits for:
  - Donations
  - Other configured triggers (extendable).
- **Rules engine** ensures:
  - Some credits cannot directly unlock prizes unless the user completes special actions.
- Engagement popup triggers automatically when user’s credits are close to the **prize threshold**.

**Where to see this:**  
- On the **Thank You Page**, after completing a donation, the popup shows awarded credits and the gap to the next milestone.

---

### 🔹 Module 4 – Engagement Nudge
- Detects **inactive users** (days of inactivity configurable via `AppConfig` model).
- Provides **in-app reactivation button** (Thank You Page).
- Grants **bonus credits** on reactivation (configurable).
- Ensures users are brought back into the platform with motivation.

**Where to see this:**  
- If a user marked inactive makes a new donation:
  - They see a **“Reactivate” button** in the Thank You popup.
  - On clicking, they receive bonus credits and their account is reactivated.
